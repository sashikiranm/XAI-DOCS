# Layer Types 

Every neural network consists of multiple layers. Each layer has a variation of the following basic operation:

```
y = Φ(Wx + b)
```

where,

```
Φ = activation function
​W = weight matrix of the layer
​b = bias
​x = input
​y = output
```

Different activation layers perform a range of mathematical functions and are named as follows:

1. Dense layer 
2. Convolution layer
3. Pooling layer
4. Recurrent layer (LSTM - Long Short Term Memory networks)
